  		<li>HTML5 semantic tags give meaning to HTML sections and makes the file more readable and accessable to on-lookers. It also allows for some standardization. I see the main tag as being very useful to help draw one's focus to the main content of the file helping one sort through many surrounding tags.</li>
  		<li>The browser displays the elements on a page in order of what you typed.</li>
  		<li>You can create snippets of code to save in sublime so that you do not have to keep typing the same code sequences over and over. I think it will be very handy especially with common structures such as a basic table.</li>
  		<li>I definitely got more familiar with semantic elements which I find hard to understand, but I think I will gain an even better understanding once I start incorporating them into my work. Then I will have to decide, well do I put a div tag here or a section tag here!</li>
