# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to save changes made to a file or folder at a given point in time. Therefore you can roll back your work if needed to access previous versions of a file or project. This is useful because it helps protect your work from major bugs as well as makes the process of working with others much smoother because you can see isolate when and who introduced a conflict and then revert back to a previous versions if the problem can not be fixed. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your main file that you can use to make changes and work on files without causing error to the master file. Branches allow users to work on multiple features of a master project at once without working directly on the master project. Work that you commit on your branch does not effect your master branch unless you decide to merge the two. This helps prevent bugs and allows you to move between different versions of your project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in your work that saves any changes you have made and creates a new version of the file. A good commit message is specific to the edit/change that was made. Do not be general and commit often.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches of a file are both worked on and the same line of code is edited. Git does not know which edits to use so a conflict occurs and you have to resolve the issue before commiting the file.
